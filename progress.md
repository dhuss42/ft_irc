## To dos
[x] read through subject and take notes of all the new concepts
[] define unknown concepts and gather information
	[x] new functions
	[] create short test programms to understand new external functions
	[] new concepts
[] reread subject with new information
[] look up RFC 2810â€“2813 (updated IRC protocol specifications)
[] create a general structure
[] divide project

## ====== Day 1 == 25.06 ======
- started reading subject (30min)
